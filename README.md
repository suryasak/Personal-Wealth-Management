# Personal-Wealth-Management
The objective of this project is to create personal wealth management by tracking income, expenditures, Investments, and goals for individuals. By tracking the goals and financials, we will be able to recommend adjustments when necessary and to provide the net worth of the customers. A personal wealth management system will also help in producing solutions if the individual is going through a personal or monetary crisis that leaves them with a lot of debt and in the way of savings.
